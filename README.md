# Chat-room-for-nft-owners
### * THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE. This is just an idea and i chose this project to learn about docker, dotnet, and improve my skills with blockchain. I could only get upto docker. And the blockchain part is not implemented at all. I hope to continue the project in the near future*
I want to implement most of the tech stacks I know in this project.
The main objective of this project for me is to get
familier with .NET and blockchain development (very different stacks), 
learning Docker,  and getting familier with proper
versioning conventions. The deliverable of this project is a deployment ready docker
container which can run the entire application with just `docker run`.

## Roadmap
